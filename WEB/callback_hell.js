// The phenomenon which happens when we nest multiple callbacks within
//  a function is called a callback hell. The shape of the resulting
//   code structure resembles a pyramid and hence callback hell is also
//    called the “pyramid of the doom”. It makes the code very difficult 
//    to understand and maintain. It is most frequently seen while working 
//    with Node.js. The code below shows an example of a callback hell.
