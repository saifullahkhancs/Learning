# Q1:- What is OOP?
# OOP is a programing language that uses objects to represent 
# the real_world entities . In python oops is implemented through classses 
# and objects . Classes are blueprint for creating object , and objects are
# the instances of the classes.


# Q2:- What is diamond problem?
# It is an ambiguity that rises when two classes C and B inherit from A
# and class D inherit from both the class B and C .
# If there is a method in A that B an C overridden and D doesnot override it
# then which version of the method does D inherit, That of B or that of C.

# Q3:- How to  solve the diamond problem?
# First of all the python does not have this problem as it contains 
# method resolution order(MRO) , 

# Method Resolution Order (MRO)
# When you inhert from the multiple classes , if their method name
# conflict , the first one named takes presedence. for example if we specified 
# or defined D(B,C). B method is called before the C.


# the __init__ method is often refered to as double undersore  intit 
#  or "" dunder intit"" for it has two underscores  on each side of its name.

# *********** dunder methods like  __init__ ,___new__  ****************

# these double underscore on both sides  of init imply that the method is 
# invoked and used internally in Python , without being required called explicitly


# There are mainly three types of Python __init__ constructors:

# Default __init__ constructor
        #    it does not accept any parameters, except for the self parameter
class Default():    
    def __init__(self):    #defining default constructor
        self.var1 = 56
        self.var2 = 27       
    def add(self):      
        print("Sum is ", self.var1 + self.var2)
obj = Default()     # since default constructor doesnâ€™t take any argument
obj.add()



# Parameterised __init__ Constructor
        #    it accepts one or more than one argument other than the self 
class Default():
    def __init__(self, n1, n2):    #defining parameterised constructor
        self.var1 = n1
        self.var2 = n2
    def add(self):
        print("Sum is ", self.var1 + self.var2)
obj = Default(121, 136)              #Creating object for a class with parameterised init
obj.add()



# __init__ With Default Parameters
        #    it only accept the default parameter that is passed in the argument 

class Teacher:
    # definition for init method or constructor with default argument
    def __init__(self, name = "Preeti Srivastava"):
        self.name = name
    def show(self):
        print(self.name, " is the name of the teacher.")
        
t1 = Teacher()                             #name is initialised with the default value of the argument
t2 = Teacher('Chhavi Pathak')    #name is initialised with the passed value of the argument
t1.show()
t2.show()

# ******************* Class and instance variable **************

# Class variables are usefull for storing values that are constant across
# all instances of a class, while instance variable are usefull for storing 
# unique values for each object created from the class.

# a class variable is defined within a class and outside of any class method.

class Employee:
    office_name = "XYZ Private Limited"

    def __init__(self):
        print(Employee.office_name)

my_instance = Employee()

class Employee:
    office_name  = "XYZ Private Limited"

    def __init__(self , employee_name , employee_id):
        self.employee_name = employee_name
        self.employee_id = employee_id

    def show(self):
        print("Name:" , self.employee_name)
        print("ID:" , self.employee_id)
        print("Office name:" , Employee.office_name)

e1= Employee("saif" , "176")
e1.show()

Employee.office_name = "pqr privat limited"
# Class variables can be initialized 
# either inside the class definition or outside the class definition
e1.show()
